# 🗓️ Linux Challenge – Week 1 Summary

## 📘 What I've Learned
This first week has been incredibly productive. I learned the basics of working with the Linux terminal and also got familiar with Windows PowerShell — something I had never tried before.

## ✅ Key Topics I Learned:
- Basic Linux navigation and file management commands
- SSH and working in remote environments
- Using nano and understanding editors like vi
- Intro to permissions, processes, and package management
- First hands-on with Windows PowerShell commands

## 🧠 What I Realized
- Linux is not as scary as it seemed — it’s logical and powerful.
- Many commands are essential and repeat often, so building muscle memory is important.
- PowerShell and Linux shells are different, but the core ideas of scripting and system control are similar.
- I feel more confident when facing issues in terminal-based environments, especially after applying what I learned in a real lab environment.

## 💡 Essential Linux Commands
Command	    Description	Example
ls	        List files in a directory	ls -l
cd	        Change directory	cd /home/ubuntu
pwd	        Show current path	pwd
touch	    Create an empty file	touch file.txt
mkdir	    Create a directory	mkdir myfolder
rm	        Delete a file or folder	rm file.txt, rm -r folder/
cp	        Copy files or folders	cp a.txt b.txt
mv	        Move or rename files	mv old.txt new.txt
nano	    Open a file in nano editor	nano config.txt
chmod	    Change file permissions	chmod +x script.sh
ps, top	    Check running processes	ps aux, top
sudo	    Run as superuser	sudo apt update

## 🪟 PowerShell – What I Touched On
- Even though the challenge focuses on Linux, I also explored Windows PowerShell, which I hadn’t used before. I practiced basic PowerShell commands like:
- Get-ChildItem (similar to ls)
- Set-Location (like cd)
- New-Item (to create files or folders)
- Remove-Item (delete files)
- Now I can navigate and manage both systems, which makes me more versatile.

## 🚀 One Week Later: How I Feel
- Just one week into the challenge:
I feel much more confident using the Linux command line.
I'm getting better at troubleshooting issues and understanding how things work.
I can move around both Linux and Windows CLI comfortably.
I’ve already used my new skills in real lab work, and it’s incredibly motivating!

## 🏁 Final Thoughts
The first week gave me a strong foundation. I’m excited to keep learning and applying even more advanced concepts in the coming weeks — especially shell scripting, permissions, networking, and containerization.
