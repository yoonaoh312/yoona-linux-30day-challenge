# 🐧 Linux Challenge – Week 2 Summary (Day 8–14)

## 🗓️ Date  
2025-08-14

## ✅ Goal  
After the first week, I feel more confident with Linux, so I added small tasks and scripts for hands-on experience. Guess what, I can create and schedule a daily folder backup using cron and do so many useful things. Here's what I've learned from the second week:

## 📚 Concepts I Learned
- Automating repetitive tasks with cron jobs
- Managing users and groups
- Monitoring and controlling processes
- Checking network status and basic troubleshooting
- Searching for files and commands efficiently
- Monitoring logs in real time and filtering output
- Customizing the terminal with aliases for efficiency

## 🔧 Small Tasks & Scripts I Created
- Scheduled a daily folder backup using cron
- Created a new user and assigned it to a custom group
- Monitored system resource usage with top and htop
- Wrote quick file search commands to locate scripts and logs

## 📝 Reflections
Some commands were already familiar from AWS re/Start, but I also learned new ones this week.
Two highlights for me:
Aliases – I love making my terminal more efficient.
File search – Being able to find exactly what I need quickly is a huge productivity boost.
