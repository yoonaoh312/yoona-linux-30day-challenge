# Day 2: Basic File Commands

## 🗓️ Date
2025-07-31

## ✅ Goal
Learn how to navigate the filesystem and manage files/directories using basic commands: ls, cd, mkdir, and cp.

## 🗂️ Key Directories and Their Purpose
Command	Description
- ls	Lists files and directories in the current location.
- cd	Changes the current directory.
- mkdir	Creates a new directory.
- cp	Copies files or directories.

## 🔍 What I Did Today
- Used ls to view contents of directories:
Tried ls -l for detailed listing and ls -a to see hidden files.
- Navigated with cd:
Moved into directories like /home and back with cd ...
- Created folders with mkdir test-folder.
- Copied files using:
cp file1.txt backup/ to copy a file into a folder.
cp -r folder1 folder2 to copy directories recursively.

## 🧠 Notes
- Absolute vs relative paths matter when using cd and cp.
- ls -lh is super useful to view file sizes in a human-readable format.
- Using Tab for autocompletion saves a lot of time!
