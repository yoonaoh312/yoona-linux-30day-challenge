# 🗂️ Day 1 – Linux Directory Structure
## 📌 What I Learned

Today I explored the Linux directory structure using the command:
```bash
ls /
I learned the purpose of important system folders:
Directory	Purpose
/etc	System configuration files
/home	User folders
/var	Variable data like logs and caches
/bin	Essential commands like ls, cp, mv
/usr	User-installed apps and libraries
/tmp	Temporary files (deleted on reboot)
