## üîç What I Did Today
- Created a new repository on GitHub.  
- Linked my local project to GitHub using `git remote add origin`.  
- Renamed the branch from `master` to `main` for consistency.  
- Pushed the local commits to GitHub with `git push -u origin main`.  
- Verified that the project is now visible on GitHub.  

## üß† Notes
- Use HTTPS or SSH to connect to GitHub; SSH is more secure for long-term use.  
- Always check `git remote -v` to ensure the correct GitHub repo is linked.  
- The first push uses `-u` to set the upstream branch, simplifying future pushes.  
- Good practice: add `.gitignore` before pushing to avoid uploading unnecessary files.
